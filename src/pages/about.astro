        Noah Syrkis's work explores the aesthetics of archives and mathematics,
        along with variations on geospatial and organic themes. Working across
        Copenhagen, Rio de Janeiro, and New York, Noah develops systems that
        translate complex and often stochastic processes into visual and
        physical form. His work occupies a space between structure and decay. As
        an artificial intelligence researcher for the Swiss Armed Forces, and
        through his work at <a href="https://virian.org" target="_blank"
            ><i>the Virian Project</i></a
        >, Noah studies complex domains by computational means. From command and
        control systems to cultural geometry, his work investigates how patterns
        evolve and dissolve in both synthetic and organic systems, employing,
        among other techniques, mechanistic interpretability and geometric deep
        learning.
