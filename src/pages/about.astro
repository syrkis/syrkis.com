            Noah Syrkis's work explores the aesthetics of archives and mathematics, along with variations on geospatial
            and organic themes. Working across Copenhagen, Rio de Janeiro, and New York, Noah develops systems that
            translate complex data into typographic and aesthetic form. His work occupies the space between rigorous
            mathematical structure and organic decay, where patterns emerge and dissolve.

            As a researcher in artificial intelligence and cultural geometry, Noah studies complex systems through
            computational meansâ€”from command and control systems to social networks. His work investigates how
            mathematical patterns emerge in both artificial and organic systems, employing multi-agent simulations and
            geometric deep learning to explore these dynamics. Through this lens, he examines the mathematical
            foundations that shape collective behavior and form.
