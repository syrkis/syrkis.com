            Noah Syrkis's work explores the aesthetics of archives and mathematics, along with variations on geospatial
            and organic themes. Working across Copenhagen, Rio de Janeiro, and New York, Noah develops systems that
            translate complex and often stochastic data into visual and physical form. His work occupies a space between
            structure and decay, where patterns emerge and dissolve.

            As a researcher in artificial intelligence and through his work at <a

                target="_blank"><i>Virian</i></a
            >, Noah studies complex domains by computational meansâ€”from command and control systems to cultural geometry
            and societal networks. His work investigates how mathematical patterns evolve in both artificial and organic
            systems, employing, among other techniques, mechanistic interpretability and geometric deep learning to
            explore these dynamics.
